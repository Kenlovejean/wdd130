        <p>Hello! My name is Ken Love Jean Jules, and I am from Carrefour, Haiti.
            I really love my country and nature, and I enjoy being outdoors.
            I am passionate about technology and learning new things.
            That is why I am creating my own website—to share more about the culture of my
            country.

        <p>Utah is a state in the western united states. It is bordered by colorado to the east,
            wyoming to the northeast, Idaho to the north, Arizona to the south, and nevada to the
            west. I also touches a corner of Mexico in the southeast. the state is a center of
            transportation, education technology, and research, and a major tourist destination for
            outdoor recreation. Salt Lake City, the state capital an largest city, is a home to the
            headquarters of the church of Jesus Christ of latter-day saints (LDS church).
